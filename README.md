## To Do List

 * ~~End turn and Start turn buttons~~
 
 * "Declare" spark graphic
   * There is no static "spark" graphic, the svg is generated dynamically on demand with a javascript library. I'd like for this project to not use Tampermonkey (or similar), but I'm afraid that this is not going to be doable without fiddling with the js and the aforementioned library especially
 
 * ~~Field zones and decks for other formats (MR3, Speed duels)~~
 
 * ~~DUEL! arrow on title screen~~
 
 * ~~Better shuffle and reveal hand button graphics~~
 
 * ~~Extra Monster Zones counter positions~~
 
 * ~~Better phase button spacing and centering~~
 
 * ~~Fix TCG and OCG labels~~
 
 * ~~Better Rock / Paper / Scissors images~~
   * Thinking about replacing the entire card rather than just the image in the future
 
 * ~~Public chat and online users window icons~~
   * ~~Duel log window icons~~
 
 * ~~Better summoning circle graphic~~
 
 * ~~Better Yes / No / Cancel buttons~~
 
 * ~~Profile avatar frames~~
 
 * ~~Duel room icons~~
 
 * ~~Better title screen social icons~~
 
 * ~~Sword replacement graphic~~

 * ~~Deck Constructor layout fix~~
 
## EXPERIMENTAL

I'm tinkering with anime card frames. The stylesheet for those is standalone and in a separate file so you can choose whether or not to use it.  
To use it, just copy the contents of "anime_style.css" and paste them at the bottom of the stylebot editor.

To-dos:
 * Pendulum frames (DB just has the green gradient which is then overlayed over the regular card frame)
 * Card names (I'd like to add them to the big text box if possible)
 * Card types and abilities (I'd like to use icons)
 * Link arrows
