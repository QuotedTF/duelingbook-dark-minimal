## To Do List

 * ~~End turn and Start turn buttons~~
 
 * "Declare" spark graphic
   * There is no static "spark" graphic, the svg is generated dynamically on demand with a javascript library. I'd like for this project to not use Tampermonkey (or similar), but I'm afraid that this is not going to be doable without fiddling with the js and the aforementioned library especially
 
 * ~~Field zones and decks for other formats (MR3, Speed duels)~~
 
 * ~~DUEL! arrow on title screen~~
 
 * ~~Better shuffle and reveal hand button graphics~~
 
 * ~~Extra Monster Zones counter positions~~
 
 * ~~Better phase button spacing and centering~~
 
 * ~~Fix TCG and OCG labels~~
 
 * ~~Better Rock / Paper / Scissors images~~
   * Thinking about replacing the entire card rather than just the image in the future
 
 * ~~Public chat and online users window icons~~
 
 * ~~Better summoning circle graphic~~
 
 * ~~Better Yes / No / Cancel buttons~~
 
 * ~~Profile avatar frames~~
